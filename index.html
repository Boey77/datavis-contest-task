              After struggling for 7 years, the team finally moved towards the right direction. 
              They signed LeBron James in 2018, which was a good start. In 2019, Lakers sent away 
              their young players to get Anthony Davis and built a new team around the two superstars.

            <p>
              Most of the new players in the team were players with proven track records. 
              However, there were also dispute and doubt. In the ESPN prediction, 
              Lakers was ranked only <font size ="9" color = "orange"> 4</font><font size ="5" color = "orange">th</font> towards the champion,  
              with <font size ="9" color = "orange">></font><font size ="9" color = "orange">50%</font> the experts believing that LeBron would 
              get 0 title in the next 4 years.

            Doubts on Lebron James got heated? after his first first year with Lakers --

            This year, he was desperate to get his respect back.

              His performance was exceptional, but the team could not get

            Vogel led the Pacers to the Eastern Conference Finals twice, 
            but both were defeated by Heats led by James. Now with the

          <p class="other-player-text-format">
            Rondo used to play for the Lakers biggest rival: the Celtics.
            He was known for his exceptional passing ability, and now 
            he’s striving for the 2nd ring the other legendary team.

          <p class="other-player-text-format">
            Howard’s last experience with Lakers was messy. This time, 
            to show the Lakers fans that he had become mature, the big 
            guy offered to sign a non-guaranteed contract with the team.

          <p class="other-player-text-format">
            It’s KCP’s 3rd year with Lakers, yet he still hadn’t got the 
            fans’ complete trust. As more players joining the team, he 
            had to show something special.

          <p class="other-player-text-format">
           In the trade for AD, Kuzma was the only young player stayed. 
           He was acclaimed for his talent on the offense side, but his 
           lack of experience on defense was also fatal. He had to 
           prove that he was the right choice.

          <p class="other-player-text-format">
            Caruso was deeply loved by the Lakers fans because of his 
            energy and toughness on court. He started as an undrafted 
            rookie and finally got a role in the team rotation with 
            his endeavor.
