            After struggling for 7 years, the team finally moved towards the right direction. 
            They signed LeBron James in 2018, which was a good start. In 2019, Lakers sent away 
            their young players to get Anthony Davis and built a new team around the two superstars.

            Most of the new players in the team were players with proven track records. 
            However, there were also dispute and doubt. In the ESPN prediction, 
            Lakers was ranked only <font size ="9" color = "orange"> 4</font><font size ="5" color = "orange">th</font> towards the champion,  
            with <font size ="9" color = "orange">></font><font size ="9" color = "orange">50%</font> the experts believing that LeBron would 
            get 0 title in the next 4 years.

                Doubts on Lebron James got heated? after his first first year with Lakers -- 
                he missed the playoffs for the 1st time since <font size ="6" color = "orange">2005 </font>. 
                This year, he was desperate to get his respect back.
